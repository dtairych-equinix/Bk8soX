# Kubernetes in a Box

Turn key Terraform repo to build a greenfield k8s cluster on Equinix Metal.  

This will deploy a master_node, plus n (min 3) worker nodes.  Networking is delivered via Calico and storage leveraging Portworx CSI.  This does require a portworx account but one can be created for free: *insert link*
